As part of the video conferencing land rush begun by Zoom, Google has moved Google Meet out of its paid, premium tier, and made it available to both consumers and professionals alike.In the same way that rival  requires you to belong to Facebook to launch a new Room,  does require users to have a Google account, such as a Gmail email address. The free tier also limits users to just 60 minutes, though the company said it won\u2019t enforce it until after September 30.There is a bit of a catch, though: Google isn\u2019t giving the ability to create meetings to everyone right away. \u201cIt\u2019s important that everyone that uses Meet has a secure and reliable experience from the start, so beginning next week, we\u2019ll be gradually expanding its availability to more and more people over the following weeks,\u201d according to a , the Google vice president in charge of G Suite, and by extension, Meet. In other words, Google will be asking users to sign up, and then be notified that the service is online.As of June 17, Google has now added Meet capabilities to meet.google.com. Google has also added Meet to the Web version of Gmail, as well as the Android and iOS apps, too.In the meantime, Google\u2019s touting the security of its Google Meet platform, the wedge that rivals are attempting to hammer between Zoom and its startling expansion to over 300 million users. Ericsson, Daimler, and some schools have banned Zoom,\u00a0, citing security concerns. Google Meet is now hosting 100 million participants daily, according to Soltero.Soltero wrote that Google Meet\u2019s insistence on using a Google account makes it more secure. Links to join participants to meetings are complex, meaning they\u2019re harder to guess and \u201cbomb\u201d with unwanted participants. Meet data is encrypted by default. Organizers also have strong controls that allows them to mute, eject, or deny entry to certain participants.\u00a0Users will be able to go to meet.google.com (or use Google Calendar) to set up a meeting, or download the iOS or Android app.\u00a0 Just a week ago, Google added a 16-person \u201cgallery view,\u201d aping Zoom\u2019s own layout that allows you to see all of the call\u2019s callers at once.\u00a0Google will maintain Google Meet\u2019s paid tier, and G Suite customers who are paying for G Suite and by extension, Meet, will receive added perks: free access to advanced features like live-streaming to up to 100,000 customers, additional Meet licenses, and free G Suite Essentials. The latter is a new, paid service for accessing more advanced features such as as dial-in phone numbers and meeting recording, Google said. It will require a consultation with a Google sales person to enable, the company said.This story, \"Google Meet is now free for everyone, as the pursuit of Zoom continues\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."},

Even though it\u2019s invitation-only until July 2020, Hey immediately picked up some buzz, with some 50,000 people waiting to get their Hey on, .On Tuesday, Hey started making headlines for a different reason.  that the latest version of the iOS app had been rejected for violation of rule 3.1.1, which stipulates that \u201cIf you want to unlock features or functionality within your app ... you must use in-app purchase.\u201d In a nutshell, Hey doesn\u2019t offer a way to subscribe to its service within its iOS app and Apple took issue with it.Hansson escalated the complaint, but Apple is so far sticking to its guns. , Apple told Basecamp that since their app \u201callows customers to access content, subscription, or features they have purchased elsewhere,\u201d users need to be able to purchase them via an in-app purchase. Since that\u2019s not available, Apple rejected the app. As to why it was allowed in the App Store in the first place, Apple simply said it shouldn\u2019t have been. In fact, it threatened to pull Hey entirely if Basecamp didn\u2019t submit an update to the existing iOS app.Oddly, Apple offers numerous exceptions to this rule, including streaming apps (Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime) and productivity apps (Slack, Outlook), as well as a variety of \u201creader\u201d apps, including \u201cmagazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as classroom management apps.\u201d , email apps are in something of a gray area and \u201ccould arguably fall under cloud storage or approved services.\u201d And Basecamp has proclaimed that Hey will never support third-party email apps due to its proprietary \u201dvertical integration,\u201d which makes its designation even trickier.Apple\u2019s Hey rejection comes at a bad time. Not only is  set to kick off in less than a week, but also this week the European Union  into whether Apple\u2019s App Store rules \u201cdistort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\u201d That\u2019s not the issue with the Hey app, but it still puts Apple and the App Store in a less-than-flattering light.And much like his commitment to changing email, Hansson isn\u2019t going to back down due to Apple\u2019s threats. Major tech voices have already chimed in to support Hey including editors at The Verge, John Gruber of Daring Fireball, and Stratechery\u2019s Ben Thompson, and Hansson has vowed to \u201cnever in a million years\u201d pay Apple a third of Hey\u2019s revenues, so Tim Cook has to deal with a very public standoff while preparing to celebrate developers in just a few days.A compromise will likely be reached, with Apple reclassifying Hey as a business app so it can circumvent the 3.1.1 rules, but the damage may already be done. As Hansson told Protocol: \u201cThat is obscene, and it\u2019s criminal, and I will spend every dollar that we have or ever make to burn this down until we get to somewhere better.\u201cThis story, \"Apple picks a fight with popular app developer Basecamp on eve of WWDC\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."},

This application accelerates the delivery of segmentation policy by enabling users to discover activities between endpoints, groups, and applications on the network.The idea is that customers can use that information to define network policies that will allow only the flows it wants and to deny others, Shenoy said.The new applications work with DNA Center\u2019s User Defined Networks feature which lets customers bring devices online \u2013 such as guest network devices \u2013 and have them automatically segmented.\u201cThe idea behind IBN is to provide automation and simplify IT operations and these new features extend the ability to add policies and segmentation to provide more intelligence to the DNA Center software stack,\u201d Shenoy said.The DNA Center enhancements were announced at Cisco\u2019s virtual user event, Cisco Live US 2020 and included other new capabilities the vendor talked about previously.\u00a0 For example the  its commitment to developing Secure Access Service Edge products and services.\u201cMoving to a SASE model will be a gradual process as enterprise IT rethinks how to connect a remote workforce to the distributed information resources they need. Flexibility will be fundamental as IT chooses among multiple security and networking capabilities that best fit their operations, regulatory requirements, and types of applications,\u201d Jeff Reed, senior vice president of product, Cisco\u2019s Security Business Group in a recent  post.\u00a0 \u201cSecurity services can be predominately delivered from the cloud to provide consistent access policies across all types of endpoints. However, globally-distributed organizations may need to apply security and routing services differently according to regional requirements,\u201d he stated.\u00a0 \u00a0Reed stated an increasingly distributed workforce requires secure access to applications with optimal performance.One of the SASE product directions Cisco pointed to was its integration of its SD-WAN package with its Umbrella service to secure SaaS \u00a0and IaaS apps for branch and remote users. Cisco Umbrella unifies secure web gateway, DNS-layer security, firewall, and cloud access security broker features in a single integrated cloud-native platform.In addition to the SASE news, Cisco said it is adding applications to its DNA Spaces mobile location services platform that uses WiFi analytics to let customers see how spaces are being used in real-time.\u00a0 The idea Cisco says is to let customers measure and use real-time density, to close off buildings when they reach capacity and send real-time notifications to devices based on their locations. And by being able to look at trends over time, facility managers can make smarter decisions on how to arrange offices or appropriate cleaning schedules, Cisco says.DNA Spaces is comprised of Cisco\u2019s Connected Mobile Experience (CMX) wireless suite and enterprise geolocation technology purchased from July Systems in 2018. Cisco CMX is a software engine that uses location and other intelligence gleaned from Cisco wireless infrastructure to generate analytics data and help deliver services to customers on their mobile devices.\u00a0 July technology included an enterprise-grade location platform which includes instant customer activation, data-driven behavioral insights, a contextual rules engine and APIs.\u00a0 The package supports any Catalyst, Aironet, or Meraki wireless access points.DNA Spaces also provides businesses with deep and accurate analytics about who and what are in their physical locations along with the ability to act on those insights in real-time, Cisco said.Cisco has also added an indoor IoT Sensor-as-a-Service that lets customers manage Bluetooth enabled IoT devices such as asset trackers for identifying, inventorying, onboarding, grouping, and applying policy-based configurations to those devices.\u00a0Cisco said customers can also now use the DNA Spaces Impact Analysis app to determine how buildings and campuses are being used \u2013 not just how much they are being used. The applications gathers data and generates reports \u00a0on time spent in the office, building utilization, and other metrics that could inform how workplaces could be reconfigured.This story, \"Cisco bulks-up advanced analytics features in DNA Center\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."},

He even used phrasing almost identical to last year's.\"We will deliver this feature update in a new way, using servicing technology (like the monthly update process) for customers running the May 2019 Update who choose to update to the new release,\" he said at the time.The end result this year will be a return to 2019's cadence, with a feature-rich upgrade released in the spring followed by a Service Pack-like refresh in the fall that will be little more than a bugs-now-fixed retread of its predecessor.\u2028 Last year,  to explain what the Redmond, Wash. developer was actually saying when it stated it would deliver a fall update with \"a scoped set of features for select performance improvements, enterprise features and quality enhancements.\"The deconstruction of Microsoft's messaging was necessary both because of the marketing-speak it used for the news but also because the firm was describing a dramatic change in one of the foundational concepts of the \"Windows as a service\" (WaaS) strategy: It was going to release only one true feature upgrade for Windows 10 that year, while the second would be but a shadow of the first.That won't need to be duplicated this year; customers have seen the major-minor cadence in action. But Cable made sure to hit some highlights to assure users there would be no real change to 2020's deliveries.. As customers found out last year, migrating from spring to fall took very little time for a number of reasons, primarily because the actual changes had been delivered the month prior. For more information on what this entails, read  and  from last year.. If there's one reason Microsoft doesn't just bag the idea of a second refresh each year, the support lifecycle is it. Microsoft  hold to the 30-month cycle for its most important customers, either by retaining the fall update or changing the spring's lifespan (which is 18 months for  versions, including Enterprise and Education). The company seems hesitant to do the latter. (Why, we're not sure.  has argued several times for just one upgrade annually.) \"For consumer or commercial users coming from versions of Windows 10 earlier than ... version 2004, the process of updating to the new release will be the same as it has been and will work in a similar manner to previous Windows 10 feature updates, using the same tools and processes,\" Cable said.While a repeat of 2019's major-minor tempo was expected by many, including , Microsoft had one rabbit to pull out of a metaphorical top hat.Microsoft is dumping the  naming format it's used since Windows 10's debut five years ago, the convention that has resulted in feature upgrade identifiers such as , , ,  and, most recently, .Instead, Microsoft will use the code-naming convention  and  familiar to Windows Insider participants. The  and  refer to the year's first half and second half, respectively.\"We will ... move to a format that represents the half of the calendar year in which the release becomes available in retail and commercial channels,\" Cable said. He also contended that the change was \"designed to provide consistency in our version names across releases for our commercial customers and partners.\"Yet Microsoft will retain descriptive names \u2013 like last month's \"Windows 10 May 2020 Update\" \u2013 for use when it communicates with consumers.In short, Microsoft reduced the number of different identifiers for any given Windows 10 refresh from three to two. Previously, the trio was composed of a descriptive name (May 2020 Update) and a four-character moniker (1903, say, for last year's spring feature upgrade), which were used interchangeably; and a different four-character nameplate (like 20H1) as a code-name of sorts during preview testing by Insiders. The last label was dropped upon release.Now, Windows 10 has two identifiers remaining, which will  be used interchangeably, but separately for different audiences.Yeah, that's not confusing.Beyond the claim that it's dropping the -formatted names \"to provide consistency\" \u2013 a weak argument, at best \u2013 Microsoft did not elaborate on why it made yet another naming change after recently upending both Office 365 and .It might be because Microsoft has had difficulty matching the numeric labels with actual date stamps of its Windows 10 upgrades. Although it settled on  and  as the last two characters \u2013 pointing to March and September, respectively \u2013 increasingly the upgrades missed those marks. Last year's 1909, for example, debuted in mid-November, and this year's 2004 began its release in late May. The yyH1 and yyH2 will account for a much broader release window, from just one month to any of six.For instance, Cable could say that \"broad availability of Windows 10, version 20H2, will begin later this calendar year,\" without worrying whether the identifier would be accurate.Insider participants who want to preview 20H2 must register with the Beta Channel (formerly called the , and then opt in by choosing the \"Download and install\" option,\u00a0.This story, \"Microsoft makes 'major-minor' Windows 10 release cadence the new normal\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."}
