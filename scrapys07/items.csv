"During a week that should be filled with leaks, spy shots, and excitement leading up to WWDC, Apple is instead making headlines for all the wrong reasons, being called “gangsters” and a “mafioso” after threatening one of its best-known developers.It all started with an email app. On Monday, Basecamp launched a “potent reintroduction of email” , a $99-a-year cross-platform subscription service that promised privacy and ease of use with 100GB of storage and a personalized email address. Even though it’s invitation-only until July 2020, Hey immediately picked up some buzz, with some 50,000 people waiting to get their Hey on, .On Tuesday, Hey started making headlines for a different reason.  that the latest version of the iOS app had been rejected for violation of rule 3.1.1, which stipulates that “If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app ... you must use in-app purchase.” In a nutshell, Hey doesn’t offer a way to subscribe to its service within its iOS app and Apple took issue with it.Hansson escalated the complaint, but Apple is so far sticking to its guns. , Apple told Basecamp that since their app “allows customers to access content, subscription, or features they have purchased elsewhere,” users need to be able to purchase them via an in-app purchase. Since that’s not available, Apple rejected the app. As to why it was allowed in the App Store in the first place, Apple simply said it shouldn’t have been. In fact, it threatened to pull Hey entirely if Basecamp didn’t submit an update to the existing iOS app.Oddly, Apple offers numerous exceptions to this rule, including streaming apps (Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime) and productivity apps (Slack, Outlook), as well as a variety of “reader” apps, including “magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as classroom management apps.” , email apps are in something of a gray area and “could arguably fall under cloud storage or approved services.” And Basecamp has proclaimed that Hey will never support third-party email apps due to its proprietary ”vertical integration,” which makes its designation even trickier.Apple’s Hey rejection comes at a bad time. Not only is  set to kick off in less than a week, but also this week the European Union  into whether Apple’s App Store rules “distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.” That’s not the issue with the Hey app, but it still puts Apple and the App Store in a less-than-flattering light.And much like his commitment to changing email, Hansson isn’t going to back down due to Apple’s threats. Major tech voices have already chimed in to support Hey including editors at The Verge, John Gruber of Daring Fireball, and Stratechery’s Ben Thompson, and Hansson has vowed to “never in a million years” pay Apple a third of Hey’s revenues, so Tim Cook has to deal with a very public standoff while preparing to celebrate developers in just a few days.A compromise will likely be reached, with Apple reclassifying Hey as a business app so it can circumvent the 3.1.1 rules, but the damage may already be done. As Hansson told Protocol: “That is obscene, and it’s criminal, and I will spend every dollar that we have or ever make to burn this down until we get to somewhere better.“This story, ""Apple picks a fight with popular app developer Basecamp on eve of WWDC"" was originally published by

"Pay no attention to those rumors that say AMD’s upcoming Zen 3 CPUs are being delayed until next year, sources tell PCWorld.Hardware circles were abuzz this week that AMD had decided to push back the highly-anticipated Zen 3 CPU, apparently because the company wanted to cash in on the popularity of the current Zen 2-based Ryzen 3000 CPUs.“AMD confirms that the rumor on ‘Zen 3’ delay is inaccurate,” an AMD spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday morning. The original report of the delay came from and was . The translations said: “According to motherboard manufacturers, sales for Ryzen 3000 series are hot. Accordingly, AMD is extending its life cycle, and definitely will not be launching the next-gen Ryzen 4000 series, based on Zen 3 architecture and using TSMC’s 7nm EUV process, in Sep. The earliest Ryzen 4000 series will enter mass production is end of 2020, and launch in Jan 2021 at CES. Whether it will be to changed to 5nm EUV process is unclear at the moment.”That caused PC fans to wring hands across the Internet, but sources tell PCWorld not to fret. This basically leaves us back at the , when AMD CEO Lisa Su said AMD was “on track to launch our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs in late 2020.”Zen 3, as its name implies, is expected to be the third iteration of the cores used in AMD’s popular CPUs.  it will be based on a 7nm+ process, offer 20 percent more density, and 10-percent power reduction compared to Zen 2. The mainstream desktop and mobile versions are codenamed Cezanne, with mainstream and high-end desktops codenamed Vermeer. An enthusiast and workstation version is codenamed Genesis Peak.This story, ""Is AMD Zen 3 delayed until 2021? Nope"" was originally published by

"Cisco has added features to is flagship network control platform, DNA Center, that introduce new analytics and problem-solving capabilities  for enterprise network customers.DNA Center is the heart of Cisco’s Intent Based Networking initiative and is the core-networking control platform that features myriad services from analytics, network management and automation capabilities to assurance setting, fabric provisioning and policy-based segmentation for enterprise networks. The company extended DNA Center’s AI Endpoint Analytics application by adding the ability to analyze the data gathered from Cisco packages such as its Identity Services Engine, Software Defined Application Visibility and Control, wireless LAN controllers or third part third-party components.The application then uses AI/ ML-based procedures in combination with Cisco’s own  dataset to identify common characteristics between endpoints that can form the basis for group classification, segmentation and policy setting, according to Prashanth Shenoy, vice president of marketing at Cisco.AI endpoint analytics lets customers identify even the most obscure types of devices anywhere, determine their attributes such as their make, model, location, OS and whether they have the latest security patches. “Once we know these details, we can accurately make an inventory, and take steps to see they are properly secured,” Shenoy said.The vendor also added Group-Based Policy Analytics that analyzes traffic from devices and presents the results  graphically so customers can visualize the flows and use them to set up rules for segmentation. This application accelerates the delivery of segmentation policy by enabling users to discover activities between endpoints, groups, and applications on the network.The idea is that customers can use that information to define network policies that will allow only the flows it wants and to deny others, Shenoy said.The new applications work with DNA Center’s User Defined Networks feature which lets customers bring devices online – such as guest network devices – and have them automatically segmented.“The idea behind IBN is to provide automation and simplify IT operations and these new features extend the ability to add policies and segmentation to provide more intelligence to the DNA Center software stack,” Shenoy said.The DNA Center enhancements were announced at Cisco’s virtual user event, Cisco Live US 2020 and included other new capabilities the vendor talked about previously.  For example the  its commitment to developing Secure Access Service Edge products and services.“Moving to a SASE model will be a gradual process as enterprise IT rethinks how to connect a remote workforce to the distributed information resources they need. Flexibility will be fundamental as IT chooses among multiple security and networking capabilities that best fit their operations, regulatory requirements, and types of applications,” Jeff Reed, senior vice president of product, Cisco’s Security Business Group in a recent  post.  “Security services can be predominately delivered from the cloud to provide consistent access policies across all types of endpoints. However, globally-distributed organizations may need to apply security and routing services differently according to regional requirements,” he stated.   Reed stated an increasingly distributed workforce requires secure access to applications with optimal performance.One of the SASE product directions Cisco pointed to was its integration of its SD-WAN package with its Umbrella service to secure SaaS  and IaaS apps for branch and remote users. Cisco Umbrella unifies secure web gateway, DNS-layer security, firewall, and cloud access security broker features in a single integrated cloud-native platform.In addition to the SASE news, Cisco said it is adding applications to its DNA Spaces mobile location services platform that uses WiFi analytics to let customers see how spaces are being used in real-time.  The idea Cisco says is to let customers measure and use real-time density, to close off buildings when they reach capacity and send real-time notifications to devices based on their locations. And by being able to look at trends over time, facility managers can make smarter decisions on how to arrange offices or appropriate cleaning schedules, Cisco says.DNA Spaces is comprised of Cisco’s Connected Mobile Experience (CMX) wireless suite and enterprise geolocation technology purchased from July Systems in 2018. Cisco CMX is a software engine that uses location and other intelligence gleaned from Cisco wireless infrastructure to generate analytics data and help deliver services to customers on their mobile devices.  July technology included an enterprise-grade location platform which includes instant customer activation, data-driven behavioral insights, a contextual rules engine and APIs.  The package supports any Catalyst, Aironet, or Meraki wireless access points.DNA Spaces also provides businesses with deep and accurate analytics about who and what are in their physical locations along with the ability to act on those insights in real-time, Cisco said.Cisco has also added an indoor IoT Sensor-as-a-Service that lets customers manage Bluetooth enabled IoT devices such as asset trackers for identifying, inventorying, onboarding, grouping, and applying policy-based configurations to those devices. Cisco said customers can also now use the DNA Spaces Impact Analysis app to determine how buildings and campuses are being used – not just how much they are being used. The applications gathers data and generates reports  on time spent in the office, building utilization, and other metrics that could inform how workplaces could be reconfigured.This story, ""Cisco bulks-up advanced analytics features in DNA Center"" was originally published by

"If you’re a fan of Windows 10’s Storage Spaces technology, Microsoft offered you a piece of advice on Wednesday: don’t update to  yet.Storage Spaces is a feature that was introduced years ago, dating back to Windows 8.1. The  takes a collection of internal and external hard drives and/or SSDs and creates a shared “pool” of storage between them. It essentially offers some RAID (Redundant Array of Disks) protections, mirroring content on one drive to another to help save it in case it fails.Granted, Storage Spaces (or RAID) might not be as critical in an age of cloud backups, digital licenses, and reliable storage. But for those who still use them, you should hold off upgrading to the Windows 10 May 2020 Update. Why? Because the May 2020 Update doesn’t properly recognize a Storage Space as an actual disk, showing up as RAW in Disk Manager and making it inaccessible. Worse still, there’s no true workaround for this issue, Microsoft said in a  today. Instead, Microsoft is offering a way to turn your Storage Spaces into essentially big old virtual DVD-ROMs for the time being, granting you read access to the Spaces but without the ability to write data. (It also recommends that you do  run the  command.) Here are Microsoft’s instructions, verbatim:Microsoft is still working through with the Windows 10 May 2020 Update, solving bugs that included the inability of Windows to find Office applications. (This was due to an issue with the Avast antivirus software, Microsoft said.)The Windows 10 May 2020 Update is still being rolled out slowly to users, with Microsoft saying on June 16 that it is “beginning the training of our machine learning (ML) based process used to intelligently select and automatically update devices approaching end of service.” This story, ""Windows 10's May 2020 Update borks pooled Storage Spaces"" was originally published by

"Microsoft released improvements to its Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL) in a Windows 10 preview build on Wednesday, with features benefiting newcomers and developers alike. As part of the update, WSL2 can now perform GPU compute functions, including using Nvidia’s CUDA technology. The new additions deliver on the  at May’s Build 2020 conference, where the company also teased graphical user interface support for the Windows Subsystem for Linux. We’re still waiting on those capabilities. WSL’s improvements are part of Windows 10 Build 20150, part of the Dev Channel of Insider builds. Formerly known as the Fast Ring, the Dev Channel is devoted to testing new features which aren’t necessarily tied to any upcoming Windows 10 feature release.As the name suggests, the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 allows you to run a Linux kernel from within Windows. WSL2 doesn’t perform quite as well as a full-fledged Linux distribution running natively on the hardware, but . WSL2 isn’t natively integrated into Windows, either. It’s an optional feature that you can choose to enable using the “Turn Windows features on and off” Control Panel within Windows 10, which will then download the necessary files and ask you to reboot your PC.One of Build 20150’s new features tries to simplify that further. By typing  as a command, Windows will take care of all of the configuration. (It’s not entirely clear whether that command can be run from the Command Line app, or if it requires the PowerShell interface.) According to a  authored by Windows program manager Craig Loewen, Microsoft plans to support automatic installation of a Linux distribution within WSL as well sometime in the future. Similarly, users can type in This story, ""Windows 10's Linux subsystem gets GPU compute and an easier install in new preview"" was originally published by

"Microsoft will repeat last year's major-minor cadence for Windows 10's upgrades, the company said Tuesday.""We will again deliver Windows 10, version 20H2 using servicing technology (like that used for the monthly update process) for customers running the May 2020 Update who choose to update to the new release,"" wrote John Cable, director of program management for the Windows Servicing and Delivery group, in a .Cable's description of the coming process echoed what he had said in July 2019, when he announced a sweeping departure from Windows 10's previous twice-a-year-upgrade model. He even used phrasing almost identical to last year's.""We will deliver this feature update in a new way, using servicing technology (like the monthly update process) for customers running the May 2019 Update who choose to update to the new release,"" he said at the time.The end result this year will be a return to 2019's cadence, with a feature-rich upgrade released in the spring followed by a Service Pack-like refresh in the fall that will be little more than a bugs-now-fixed retread of its predecessor.  Last year,  to explain what the Redmond, Wash. developer was actually saying when it stated it would deliver a fall update with ""a scoped set of features for select performance improvements, enterprise features and quality enhancements.""The deconstruction of Microsoft's messaging was necessary both because of the marketing-speak it used for the news but also because the firm was describing a dramatic change in one of the foundational concepts of the ""Windows as a service"" (WaaS) strategy: It was going to release only one true feature upgrade for Windows 10 that year, while the second would be but a shadow of the first.That won't need to be duplicated this year; customers have seen the major-minor cadence in action. But Cable made sure to hit some highlights to assure users there would be no real change to 2020's deliveries.. As customers found out last year, migrating from spring to fall took very little time for a number of reasons, primarily because the actual changes had been delivered the month prior. For more information on what this entails, read  and  from last year.. If there's one reason Microsoft doesn't just bag the idea of a second refresh each year, the support lifecycle is it. Microsoft  hold to the 30-month cycle for its most important customers, either by retaining the fall update or changing the spring's lifespan (which is 18 months for  versions, including Enterprise and Education). The company seems hesitant to do the latter. (Why, we're not sure.  has argued several times for just one upgrade annually.) ""For consumer or commercial users coming from versions of Windows 10 earlier than ... version 2004, the process of updating to the new release will be the same as it has been and will work in a similar manner to previous Windows 10 feature updates, using the same tools and processes,"" Cable said.While a repeat of 2019's major-minor tempo was expected by many, including , Microsoft had one rabbit to pull out of a metaphorical top hat.Microsoft is dumping the  naming format it's used since Windows 10's debut five years ago, the convention that has resulted in feature upgrade identifiers such as , , ,  and, most recently, .Instead, Microsoft will use the code-naming convention  and  familiar to Windows Insider participants. The  and  refer to the year's first half and second half, respectively.""We will ... move to a format that represents the half of the calendar year in which the release becomes available in retail and commercial channels,"" Cable said. He also contended that the change was ""designed to provide consistency in our version names across releases for our commercial customers and partners.""Yet Microsoft will retain descriptive names – like last month's ""Windows 10 May 2020 Update"" – for use when it communicates with consumers.In short, Microsoft reduced the number of different identifiers for any given Windows 10 refresh from three to two. Previously, the trio was composed of a descriptive name (May 2020 Update) and a four-character moniker (1903, say, for last year's spring feature upgrade), which were used interchangeably; and a different four-character nameplate (like 20H1) as a code-name of sorts during preview testing by Insiders. The last label was dropped upon release.Now, Windows 10 has two identifiers remaining, which will  be used interchangeably, but separately for different audiences.Yeah, that's not confusing.Beyond the claim that it's dropping the -formatted names ""to provide consistency"" – a weak argument, at best – Microsoft did not elaborate on why it made yet another naming change after recently upending both Office 365 and .It might be because Microsoft has had difficulty matching the numeric labels with actual date stamps of its Windows 10 upgrades. Although it settled on  and  as the last two characters – pointing to March and September, respectively – increasingly the upgrades missed those marks. Last year's 1909, for example, debuted in mid-November, and this year's 2004 began its release in late May. The yyH1 and yyH2 will account for a much broader release window, from just one month to any of six.For instance, Cable could say that ""broad availability of Windows 10, version 20H2, will begin later this calendar year,"" without worrying whether the identifier would be accurate.Insider participants who want to preview 20H2 must register with the Beta Channel (formerly called the , and then opt in by choosing the ""Download and install"" option, .This story, ""Microsoft makes 'major-minor' Windows 10 release cadence the new normal"" was originally published by

"Google Meet is now free for everyone. As part of the video conferencing land rush begun by Zoom, Google has moved Google Meet out of its paid, premium tier, and made it available to both consumers and professionals alike.In the same way that rival  requires you to belong to Facebook to launch a new Room,  does require users to have a Google account, such as a Gmail email address. The free tier also limits users to just 60 minutes, though the company said it won’t enforce it until after September 30.There is a bit of a catch, though: Google isn’t giving the ability to create meetings to everyone right away. “It’s important that everyone that uses Meet has a secure and reliable experience from the start, so beginning next week, we’ll be gradually expanding its availability to more and more people over the following weeks,” according to a , the Google vice president in charge of G Suite, and by extension, Meet. In other words, Google will be asking users to sign up, and then be notified that the service is online.As of June 17, Google has now added Meet capabilities to meet.google.com. Google has also added Meet to the Web version of Gmail, as well as the Android and iOS apps, too.In the meantime, Google’s touting the security of its Google Meet platform, the wedge that rivals are attempting to hammer between Zoom and its startling expansion to over 300 million users. Ericsson, Daimler, and some schools have banned Zoom, , citing security concerns. Google Meet is now hosting 100 million participants daily, according to Soltero.Soltero wrote that Google Meet’s insistence on using a Google account makes it more secure. Links to join participants to meetings are complex, meaning they’re harder to guess and “bomb” with unwanted participants. Meet data is encrypted by default. Organizers also have strong controls that allows them to mute, eject, or deny entry to certain participants. Users will be able to go to meet.google.com (or use Google Calendar) to set up a meeting, or download the iOS or Android app.  Just a week ago, Google added a 16-person “gallery view,” aping Zoom’s own layout that allows you to see all of the call’s callers at once. Google will maintain Google Meet’s paid tier, and G Suite customers who are paying for G Suite and by extension, Meet, will receive added perks: free access to advanced features like live-streaming to up to 100,000 customers, additional Meet licenses, and free G Suite Essentials. The latter is a new, paid service for accessing more advanced features such as as dial-in phone numbers and meeting recording, Google said. It will require a consultation with a Google sales person to enable, the company said.This story, ""Google Meet is now free for everyone, as the pursuit of Zoom continues"" was originally published by
