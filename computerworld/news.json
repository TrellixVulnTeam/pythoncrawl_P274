Where they are in conflict, we respect national law while seeking to respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights.\u201dThe policy doesn\u2019t mention any nation by name and points to the company\u2019s focus on privacy protection, and agrees it should do more to protect these freedoms.\u00a0The move is widely seen as a reaction to pressure Apple has faced concerning censorship in China, though China is not the only nation to limit such matters.In a sense, Apple was driven to make the commitment: 40.6% of investors voted against Apple management during the last meeting to support a similar proposal.Apple watchers will know this level of support is unheard of for shareholder proposals that oppose company recommendations, so it is likely this helped guide the decision.\u00a0Organizations that have supported the campaign for Apple to uphold human rights and freedom of expression include several groups concerned with Tibet, the Uyghur people and the  campaigning group.These groups will now push Apple to issue regular reports on its progress in implementing its new policy.Sondhya Gupta, Campaign Manager, SumOfUs, said:When it comes to human rights, the document Apple has published cites a commitment based on specific policy documents that include:Among other rights protected by these documents are a ban on child labor and respect for freedom of association.Consumers worldwide are becoming more aware of the need for privacy and control over their own personal information.\u00a0This is why so many consumers have, for example, rejected COVID-19 track-and-trace apps that do not have privacy baked into their systems. It is also why increasing numbers use alternative search engines and privacy protecting social media services.This trend is accompanied by another:\u00a0The race to digital transformation means every business is becoming a data business, while data analytics systems enable information to be used for a rapidly expanding set of purposes. From Cambridge Analytica to public transit management, all these systems rely on data, which can be used for both good and ill.These twin strands of privacy and opportunity don't easily reconcile and as they rush to transform business, enterprises globally are discovering that corporate responsibility now extends into sectors that were at one time not really seen as business-related.Apple's response has been to  into its solutions to limit the potential for egregious acts.This trend seems set to continue.Discussing Apple\u2019s move, Steven Heim of  said:The take-away from this for anyone doing business must surely be to underscore the importance of corporate responsibility on such matters, particularly when COVID-19, climate change and the Black Lives Matter movement are exposing big structural challenges that must be met.Signing off on its proposal, Apple states:Please follow me on"},

Two of the bugs were marked \"High,\" Google's second-most-serious threat level. One of those flaws, which Google said was in the iOS version of Chrome, was reported by a member of Microsoft's browser vulnerability research team. Microsoft now relies on the same core technologies \u2014 those produced by the Google-dominated Chromium project \u2014 for its Edge browser as Google does for Chrome.Chrome updates in the background, so most users can finish the refresh by relaunching the browser. To manually update, select \"About Google Chrome\" from the Help menu under the vertical ellipsis at the upper right; the resulting tab shows that the browser has been updated or displays the download process before presenting a \"Relaunch\" button. People new to Chrome can  for Windows, macOS and Linux directly.Google updates Chrome approximately every six weeks; the previous upgrade was released July 14.Google bundled several new tab features into Chrome 85; one added functionality to the  that debuted earlier this year.With tab grouping, users can organize tabs in \u2014 where else? \u2014 the tab bar by lumping together several tabs, each lump designated by color and name. New tabs can be added to the group by dragging and dropping or from a right-click menu; existing tabs can be dumped from a group as well.Chrome 85 lets users collapse and expand those tab groups. A click on the group's label collapses all associated tabs into the label, removing them from the bar. A second click restores them to the bar. \"This was the most popular feature request we heard from those of you using tab groups,\" wrote Alex Ainslie, Chrome's director of UX (user experience), in an Aug. 25 post to a company blog.Ainslie said that Google was rolling out tab group collapse/expansion, meaning that it won't be available to everyone at once. To turn on the new feature manually, enter  in the address bar and press Return or Enter. Search for the  item and select  from the menu list at the right. Finally, restart Chrome.Google also introduced  in Chrome 85, the Beta build. When the user pauses the mouse pointer atop a tab, a thumbnail of the page appears in a small pop-up, portraying what the tab leads to. Chrome 85 Stable users can manually engage previews by using  and setting both  and  to . \u2028 in Chrome 85 after \"Profile Guided Optimization\" (PGO) was switched on.This  technology \u2014 a Microsoft invention \u2014 was , when Google asserted it would make Chrome up to 15% faster. That initial effort used the Microsoft Visual C++ build environment.In Google's latest PGO effort, the company's engineers expanded PGO from just Windows to include macOS by turning to the  build environment. Google will roll out \u2014 turn on, in plainer terms \u2014 PGO over time in Chrome 85.Chrome 85 also suspended page painting in browser windows covered by other windows, a way to save on CPU processing and thus save on power consumption. Only some users will see this in the latest Chrome, however. Google promised a \"full rollout\" for Chrome 86, the next upgrade.(This functionality has been pledged for what seems like ages. At one point, the page painting suspension had been on the to-do list of March's Chrome 81, only to get punted, first to Chrome 83 (May) and then to 84 (July) with roll-out to be finalized in Chrome 85.)According to Google, it will enable a new PDF-related feature in Chrome 85 \"over the next few weeks.\" Users will be able to fill out PDF-based forms \u2014 account applications, for instance \u2014 from within the browser, then save the results. If the same PDF document is later opened, the already-entered information is retained, and the user can pick up where they left off.Chrome 85 also continues the multi-version implementation of a blockade imposed on downloads from insecure sources. The first download category \u2014 executable files in .exe format, for example \u2014 was barred here with more to follow from Chrome 86 through Chrome 88.On the enterprise side, the Legacy Browser Support (LBS) add-on is to be scrubbed from the Chrome Web Store during Chrome 85's run. \"LBS is now built into Chrome, and the old extension is no longer needed,\" Google said.(LBS was designed so IT admins could deploy Google's browser but still call up Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) when necessary to, say, render intranet sites or older, written-for-IE apps. LBS wasn't an emulator but simply a URL director, sending any links on an administrator-made list to IE for that browser to open.)As of Monday, .

Nothing notable (again)", "img_url": "https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2017/02/p1200660-100708728-large.jpg", "contents": "For a company whose future depends on attracting more users to its primary product, Mozilla has taken a lackadaisical approach to boosting Firefox's features and functionality over the last four upgrades.On Tuesday, Mozilla released Firefox 80, the fourth upgrade in a row to lack compelling new features visible to end users.At the same time, Mozilla engineers patched , including three rated as \"high,\" the organization's second-most-serious threat ranking.Firefox 80 can be downloaded for Windows, macOS and Linux from . Because Firefox updates in the background, most users receive the latest version when they relaunch the browser. To manually update on Windows, pull up the menu under the three horizontal bars at the upper right, then click the help icon (the question mark within a circle). Choose \"About Firefox.\" (On macOS, \"About Firefox\" can be found under the \"Firefox\" menu.) The resulting page shows that the browser is either up to date or displays the in-process refresh.Mozilla upgrades Firefox every four weeks, a faster tempo than rivals such as Google's Chrome or Microsoft's Edge. Mozilla last upgraded the browser July 28.Like June's Firefox 77 and 78, and July's Firefox 79, this month's Firefox 80 adds next to nothing to the browser's visible feature or functionality lists.Mozilla itself  of note: first, Firefox can now be set as the system-wide default for viewing PDF files, and second, it improves on how screen readers, tools used by vision-impaired, translate the browser's menus.Other changes Mozilla took the time to tout ranged from a decrease in the number of animations \"such as tab loading to reduce motion for users with migraines and epilepsy,\" to an  that turns off a confirmation dialog when employees submit a form from an insecure page.It's been months since a Firefox upgrade has had enough visible new to outweigh changes under the hood. For example, Mozilla didn't bother pitching any user-seen new or improved features or functionality in July's Firefox 79. The Firefox before that, version 78, could muster only a few minor tweaks to the browser's privacy dashboard. And  passed on describing Firefox 77 entirely because it contained so little of interest to end users. (Virtually every Firefox upgrade offers  for website and web app developers.)That's not really a trend that Mozilla will want to advertise.Firefox's troubles are not mysteries. Its browser share \u2013 as measured by California-based Net Applications \u2013 fell to 7.3% in July, a mark 1.1 percentage points lower than its share a year earlier. That represented a 12-month decline of 13%. , the number of Firefox's monthly active users (MAU) has fallen 15% since the start of this year.Financially, Mozilla is in no better shape: Its most recently-reported balance sheet \u2013 for the 2018 calendar year \u2013 showed a . The year was the first in which the organization spent more than it brought in.And only two weeks ago, , about a quarter of its workforce, claiming that the coronavirus pandemic had \"significantly impacted our revenue.\"With those headwinds, one might expect Mozilla to work overtime to craft engaging features and build atop core existing functionality, such as privacy.Perhaps Firefox's rapid release tempo \u2013 it accelerated to an  earlier this year \u2013 diluted what appeared in each upgrade. The coronavirus pandemic and work-from-home mandates may have affected development, resulting in fewer new bits to include in the browser's upgrades. And talk of additional layoffs after Mozilla let go 70 employees in January \u2013 Mozilla said it had continued to discuss the likelihood of more through the spring \u2013 would not have helped morale or made workers particularly productive.It remains unclear how Mozilla plans to make Firefox more interesting to users and what the strategy will be to grow the browser's base \u2013 or even whether Firefox remains \u00a0the heart of Mozilla's grand design. When Mozilla disclosed its latest layoff round, Mitchell Baker, Mozilla's CEO, . Although Firefox was certainly mentioned, Baker put more emphasis on other strategies, notably new products and services, as a way to grow Mozilla.The next upgrade, Firefox 81, will be released Sept. 22."},

The  had yet to become a mainstay of work-from-home employees forced out of the office by the COVID-19 pandemic.But the\u00a0\u00a0this week that took the company\u2019s meeting and webinar services offline highlights the fact that\u00a0enterprise tech outages no longer just affect white-collar workers.Though some users across the U.S. and parts of Europe took to social media to express relief at missing on-camera meetings, key workers and front-line users such as teachers \u2014 who remain heavily reliant on videoconferencing to get work done \u2014 found themselves unable to perform their jobs.Zoom did not explain what caused the outage,  only that it had found the issue and resolved it. (, which tracks various tech outages, showed the spike in problems on Monday that arose when the platform problems began.)It's unclear how many organizations, companies and school districts were affected. But users took to Twitter to voice annoyance that they could not access the platform. Given that many schools in the U.S. have moved to online learning, the outage was especially problematic on what was the first day of school for many.For example, the University of Iowa reported that 1,359 meetings had been scheduled to take place during the outage, . Planned online classes for students in the . And schools and universities in Atlanta and Durham, N.C. as well as Pennsylvania State University all reported problems, .One teacher in Memphis, Tenn.\u00a0who asked to be identified only by her first name, Amber, said the outage caused students to miss out on two classes, including a homeroom session meant to set them up for the day, check on their health and well-being, and focus on social-emotional learning.Her school began using Zoom earlier this month, opting for the platform because of the in-meeting features it provides to meeting hosts \u2014 in this case, teachers. \u00a0\u201cI believe we made the switch to Zoom because it offers more robust features than Microsoft Teams\u00a0\u2014 breakout rooms, it\u2019s more aligned with our classroom presentation software of NearPod (an interactive lesson platform) and it allows us to control muting/unmuting as well as renaming of students as participants, unlike Google Meet,\u201d Amber said.When the outage hit, Amber said teachers at her school were told to post a self-paced NearPod lesson for students to complete for a grade \u2014 and to make sure they were available via  for any questions or concerns from students.\u00a0While the school was able to put together an alternate plan, there was no formal process in place for an outage and no communication when teachers started experiencing difficulties right before home room.\u201cTeachers largely were left to themselves before a formal announcement was made, already through homeroom and another period of class, so they had made their own workarounds. It would have gone much more smoothly had we previously figured out what to do, pre-created self-paced lessons, and utilized those\u00a0\u2014 without the expectation of last-minute changes,\u201d Amber said.\u201cZoom\u2019s outage forced me to change my plans for the day and then to continue to minimize uneven instruction for students throughout the day, stick to a less engaging lesson so that we can resume the following day,\u201d she added.The ability to shift business processes during an outage is even more important now that workers are scattered than it might have been in the past. That's especially true for companies that have had to build processes on the fly amid the pandemic.When countries first went into lockdown in the spring, said Chris Weston, a principal in European advisory at IDC EMEA, there was a definite \u201ccoping\u201d stage where companies shifted to whatever tools they had available or could procure easily and cheaply. That was followed by a consolidation stage, where security and resilience were reviewed.Weston, who has\u00a0spoken to numerous organizations over the past six months about collaboration tools and videoconferencing strategies,\u00a0noted that a lot of platforms suffered glitches as demand outstripped capacity. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic meant most companies were tolerant of problems, willing to overlook small, unobtrusive issues around functionality because they needed these platforms in place for employees.Research by\u00a0\u00a0showed that while some businesses faced a steep learning curve and performance issues early in the shutdown, two out of three businesses (64%) now feel they can function beyond six months without a major disruption. (That figure is up from 49% in March.)In other words, companies saw the need to be flexible and have found ways of doing so.\u201cPeople have learned to be more resilient and turn to their own unofficial tools if the 'official' ones let them down,\" he said. \u201cThey go to Google Meet or FaceTime and WhatsApp if they need to.\u201cOrganizations should be asking their staff and teams to think about how they will manage if the official tools aren\u2019t available for a period of time and to suggest some alternatives \u2014 I think the command-and-control, \u2018This is how it\u2019s done' style will lose out to empowering people to use the right tools for them, within reason,\u201d Weston said.Raul Castanon, senior analyst in workforce productivity and collaboration at 451 Research S&P Global Market intelligence, said that companies with multiple communications and collaboration tools in place got to that point because of organic growth, not necessarily because they sought redundancy to handle unexpected outages.\u201cOrganizations are looking to streamline and eliminate redundancies in their collaboration platforms, but given the number of employees now working remotely, these have become critical for business continuity,\u201d Castanon said. \u201cThis will put more pressure on vendors to provide a higher level of reliability. Zoom is already taking steps in that direction with Oracle Cloud. For organizations, this will likely result in the need to be more methodical about having redundant systems in place.\u201dWhile unofficial tools might provide viable workarounds for office workers \u2014 it\u2019s perfectly normal to catch up with a colleague by phone \u2014 That's not always the case. Teachers, for example, would not be able to teach a lesson over WhatsApp and could only turn to a platform like Google Meet if the school has a license for it and pupils can access the tool.Amber teaches in a primarily low-income, mostly Black and Latinx high school where some students do not have a dedicated workspace to themselves to log in. Other students are still working or have family obligations, including looking after younger siblings during school hours. Still others communicate primarily in a language other than English and can struggle with understanding basic directions written over email.For students like this, any major disruptions to the school day can have a significant impact on their ability to learn. Not only are they missing lessons in the short term, but those with challenging home lives are less likely to be able to catch up or have access to alternate platforms to facilitate learning by other means.Castanon believes that the Zoom outage will lead to a surge of demand for vendors focusing on distance learning and, although Zoom has already targeted that segment, most schools would likely benefit from a platform that offers a more focused approach to learning.\u201cUnfortunately, given its nature, the transition to distance learning will probably take longer than that of remote working and this will likely have an impact for students,\u201d he said. \u201cSchools might need the entire school year to figure things out; this is assuming that all students have similar learning conditions\u00a0\u2014 i.e., internet access and computers or tablets for home schooling.\u201dAmber hopes the outage will lead to her school putting a more definitive action plan in place. That also includes hardware \u2014 the Chromebooks her school provided are unable to run Zoom for all students, along with presentation software and NearPod, without overheating, turning off, or experiencing video and audio problems.\u00a0As for the platform itself, Castanon points out that Zoom has skillfully addressed several major challenges this year, including a surge in demand \u2014 and has come out better positioned to grow.\u201cWhile it may end up losing some customers along the way, I think the company has proven it can overcome these issues better than most,\u201d he said."},

Again.You'd think I'd be used to the company's habit of announcing things before they're actually available by now, but nope \u2014 this past week, I fell for one of Google's classic traps.The company put out a  on Tuesday about a new Assistant feature, y'see. It lets you send an audio message to anyone simply by talking to your phone. You just say, \"Hey Google, send an audio message,\" and poof! Just like that, your phone starts recording and then sends your spoken missive to whomever you want. Magical! Spiffy! Exciting! I couldn't wait to try it! And then, well...That's what I saw on my Google-made Pixel 4 last Tuesday, the day the feature was announced and said to be \"available in English-speaking countries around the globe, as well as in Portuguese in Brazil.\" And that's what I see on that phone \u2014 Google's current Android flagship device, mind you \u2014 this morning, a full week after the feature's announcement was made.Sigh.It's an all-too-familiar tale for anyone who uses Android \u2014 or Google services, for that matter: You see Google announce some intriguing new feature or update. You say to yourself (as one does): \"Gee willikers, that sure sounds useful!\" You hurry to wrap your sweaty little fingies around the nearest gadget to find the feature and take it out for a spin.And then, sure enough, you realize the feature inexplicably isn't on your device. The excitement turns to frustration, maybe with a dash of confusion and a sprinkling of resentment. You eventually move on with your life, and by the time the feature makes its way to you \u2014 anywhere from a few weeks to a matter of months later, typically with no fanfare or announcement of its arrival \u2014 you've completely forgotten about it and probably don't even notice.Now, look, I get it: Google loves to announce things and then take an eternity to roll 'em out to everyone. It's part of its identity. It's who Google is. Saying that something is \"rolling out over the coming weeks\" (or sometimes \"over the coming months\") is an almost comically cliche line at this point.But you know what? It's also pretty obnoxious. And on some level, it's self-defeating, too. I mean, really: Is there any better way to dampen excitement and make sure no one notices when a feature actually launches than to announce it before it's available and then trickle it out at a tortoise-like pace? And is there any better way to irritate people than to tell them to try something and then let them get a vexing response like the one I received \u2014 that oblivious-seeming \"Sorry, I can't do that yet\" error \u2014 when they do?The most frustrating thing is how frequently this happens. Sometimes, the situation is at least  with the proper context, like what we saw with the high-profile reveal of a real-time translation-transcription feature in the Android Translate app earlier this year. It was announced and shown off , when it was said to be arriving \"in the future,\" and then it launched widely\u00a0. But just as often, it's a situation more like the one I'm encountering now, where something is announced and made to like it's readily available \u2014 only to be followed by metaphorical crickets and maddening wild goose chases.Heck, it even happens with Google's own Pixel feature drops \u2014 software updates sent only to the company's completely self-controlled and relatively small-scale herd of homemade phones. With the , in June, Lifehacker said what countless Pixel owners were almost certainly thinking:Officially, the implied reason for such phased rollouts is often that it allows Google to catch any issues resulting from a change before they become widespread. But, c'mon: There's gotta be a better way to handle that in terms of both timing and public presentation. We  there is, in fact, because Google itself avoids this built-in bummer-spreading at least some of the time.One especially ironic-seeming example is in the area of\u00a0 \u2014 y'know, the realm where most Android device-makers  named Google fumble and take  to get current software delivered to device-owners. There, Google does exceptionally well and manages to get updates out to all of its Pixel users almost instantly. Those updates are larger and more complex than any minor feature rollout. And yet, here we are.I've talked before about how Google is , and this is another vexing example of how the company gets in its own way and turns what should be an overwhelmingly positive development into a needlessly negative experience \u2014 not just for anyone, either, but for its most enthusiastic and engaged users in particular.You could make an argument that we all should know better by now and shouldn't be surprised by this sort of stuff anymore. And, well, you wouldn't be wrong. But at the same time, we shouldn't  to treat every new Google announcement with a grain of salt and assume it's up to to keep checking our phones every day to see when something actually arrives. That's just plain silly.It's a waste of goodwill\u00a0\u2014 and a waste of good features that all too often end up going unnoticed."},

I view iPhone 12 as a once-in-a-generation opportunity in terms of the upgrade cycle,\u201d\u00a0.We\u2019ve heard analysts say stuff like this before, of course.\u00a0Both positive and negative predictions tend to emerge just before iPhone launches every year, though economists and analysts are particularly keen for positive economic news this time around as the pandemic continues its bite.The difference this year is that Apple has reconfigured the iPhone range to reach a much broader range of potential buyers, with products straddling the market, from its traditional high-end models to more affordable mid-range devices.The success of this strategy has already seen tens of millions of customers upgrade to an iPhone SE. A recent CIRP report claimed it now accounts for .\u201cEvery few years Apple comes out with a new low-priced iPhone, with up-to-date features, to sweep up the customers using the oldest iPhones,\u201d said CIRP\u2019s Mike Levin.While Apple\u2019s decision to widen the market surely predates the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision has enabled it to maintain a presence in a rapidly transforming economic reality.Apple\u2019s efforts\u00a0\u00a0also supports the strategy, enhancing lifetime per-user revenue.I wouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised to see the company continue to offer free access to Apple TV+ content to new iPhone purchasers this year. It will, after all, hope to also convince its customers to try and buy its other services, and will be pushing hard on its .Apple has\u00a0 that it will introduce its new iPhones in a slightly different way than before (), which suggests the release .Taiwanese suppliers, for example, report that they  for next-generation iPhones, which syncs up with that notion.When it comes to the phones, new 5G support, improved (120Hz on the Pro?) displays, enhanced photography features and insanely fast processors will certainly boost interest at the high-end.The company is also expected to introduce new AirPods Pro, a thinner Apple Watch and the first Apple Silicon-powered MacBook at this time \u2013 all of which will spice up interest in what the company is doing.When the new iPhones arrive, Apple may reduce prices on all its existing devices.The company hasn\u2019t said anything about this, but I've seen some speculation it may drop the price of the iPhone SE to $349 and offer up iPhone 12 devices beginning \u00a0around $699. There's no guarantee these price predictions will prove accurate, however.So interest will be high.\u00a0Will they generate a supercycle?That\u2019s open to question, but the true stakes are visible in a recent Gartner report, which shows that while , Apple\u2019s own have held steady:Samsung sales fell 27.1%, Huawei declined 6.8%, Apple declined by just 0.4%, while all other makers saw decline in double figures.In other words, even relatively flat sales could be seen as a success in this turbulent market \u2013 particularly if this leads to relative market share gains.There have been claims the company may introduce the new models without an event, just via a press release, which seems unlikely.\u00a0Leaker Jon Prosser\u00a0\u00a0the new iPhones will be announced at an October event, which seems far more likely. A video-based product introduction in late September or (more likely) early October seems probable.What next? Looking to the future, Apple\u2019s contract chip manufacturer, TSMC, is expected to begin  in the second half of 2022. These will deliver yet another leap in power and performance in mobile devices, and (potentially, given the move to Apple Silicon) future Macs.TSMC is already building a facility for , but those will be way down the line. Though it is important to note that Apple already has a road map for future evolution of its important mobile device category, even while processor innovation for other mobile devices remains relatively slow.Please follow me on"},

It looks like a fix for the long-lamented version 2004 defrag bugs is on the way, but we aren\u2019t there yet. Lenovo isn\u2019t too happy with the August version 2004 cumulative update. It\u2019s still too early to move to 2004, in my opinion \u2014 and those problems ensure I\u2019ll keep 2004 off my machines for a while.Meanwhile, Microsoft extended the end of support date for Win10 version 1803 \u2014 a move that\u2019ll interest exactly nobody except for admins with aging Win10 machines. Windows 8.1 patchers got left out in the Remote Access cold for a week. The .NET security updates have an odd, acknowledged bug with a manual registry workaround.On the whole, though, the August patches have held up quite well.As a bit o\u2019 lagniappe, Patch Lady Susan Bradley has published the results of her two Patching Surveys \u2014 one for Consumers, the other for IT Pros. As you might imagine, the general level of satisfaction with Windows patches leaves much to be desired.The August cumulative update for Win10 version 2004,  \u2014 the latest, bestest, bug-infested version of Windows 10 \u2014 has triggered the usual volley of complaints about blue screens, system slowdowns, crashes, and the like.  has details.Most disconcerting is the volley of BSoDs  on 2019 and 2020 ThinkPads:The bugs appear to be linked to using the Enhanced Windows Biometric Security setting in the ThinkPad\u2019s BIOS. See the article for details.The other big Win10 version 2004 news lies in the highly anticipated fix to the defrag bug that I . In spite of the recent, breathless headlines about a \u201cnew\u201d bug in version 2004, this pesky little SSD biter has been documented on various Microsoft sites since January \u2014 before version 2004 shipped.The bug involves an incorrectly set timestamp on defrag runs: Since the \u201cOptimize Drives\u201d app relies on that timestamp to keep from running too frequently, a bad timestamp leads to an overabundance of defrag runs, which can hurt any drive \u2014 but especially solid-state drives. There are also reports of TRIM function bugs associated with the Optimize Drives app. Those may be more serious. Lawrence Abrams  has details.In theory, Microsoft . The fix may well appear in the \u201coptional, non-security, C/D Week\u201d patch for version 2004 that\u2019s due any day now (making it an \u201cE Week\u201d patch). Most people expect that it\u2019ll be part of the September Patch Tuesday crop.If Microsoft does, indeed, fix the bug, it\u2019ll be another significant  bug in 2004 that\u2019s finally met its match.Microsoft releases an update to KB4023057 \u2014 the \u201cUpdate to Windows 10, versions 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709, 1803, 1809, 1903, and 1909 for update reliability\u201d patch \u2014 when it\u2019s ready to start steamrolling new versions. I last talked about the patch .You\u2019ll see the patch offered if you haven\u2019t yet moved to Win10 version 2004 and your PC appears to need it (with MS\u2019s \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d playing the part of King Solomon). The patch itself isn\u2019t available in the Microsoft Catalog because it\u2019s delivered via the extra-official .If you want to move to 2004, and you\u2019re offered KB4023057, go ahead and take it \u2014 but realize . If you\u2019d rather wait for the inevitable fixes \u2014 such as the defrag fix mentioned in the preceding section, and  both acknowledged and in gotcha mode \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to install it yet.The Knowledge Base articles for all of the August .NET patches have been modified to include a note about an odd bug.  (the \u201cSecurity and Quality Rollup for .NET Framework 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2 for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP2\u201d) and the various KBs for .NET Framework 4.8 now have this admonishment:Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) applications that use two or more HostVisual elements belonging to a common thread, where both HostVisual elements are asked to disconnect from their visual target at roughly the same time, mail fail with the following error:Exception type:\u00a0 System.COMExceptionMessage:\u00a0 UCEERR_RENDERTHREADFAILURE (HRESULT 0x88980406)Callstack:\u00a0 top frame is System.Windows.Media.Composition.DUCE+Channel.SyncFlush()There\u2019s a manual fix that involves changing app.config or modifying the registry.Usually Microsoft patches all versions of Windows at the same time. This month, though, Windows 8.1 missed two security holes in Windows Remote Access.Eight days after the Patch Tuesday plop, Windows 8.1 got an additional patch, , that only fixes those two security holes. It\u2019s a catch-up patch of a patch. In order to get all of your Win 8.1 August patches, you have to install the second patch, too \u2014 or wait for the September Monthly Rollup, which should plug all the known holes.There\u2019s also a  about this second patch not playing politely with Cisco AnyConnect.

In theory, you\u2019ll be able to use Apple\u2019s Look Around feature to check how these places look from the high street, and then explore them more deeply by exploring user submitted images.At a time when social distancing and lockdowns are likely to become part of modern living, for some of us this may be the only way we can return to some of our most special places for a while.The implications for business are perhaps greater. Business owners will want to generate those positive user reviews in Google, Yelp and in Apple Maps, as they know good reviews generate business. They will want to populate Maps with images that show their business in a good light.Every business owner expects a little criticism.Everyone makes mistakes or gets misunderstood from time to time, but how can we ensure that vexatious reviews aren\u2019t left behind?I\u2019m not certain Apple has fully thought this part of the paradigm through. Over time, it will certainly need to introduce some form of post-publication vetting system to ensure it doesn\u2019t unwittingly carry vexatious reviews/images designed to trash competitors.It is reassuring that the company has taken some steps in the right direction to protect against such incidents:Those three lines of defence should help mitigate the kind of negativity that impacts other user-generated review communities.All the same, business owners will certainly hope to gain some input into what is published about their operations through Maps, potentially via  portal, where businesses can already .The potential to create, verify and publish indoor maps of some locations via this feature must surely be part of the company\u2019s medium-term plan, given the LiDAR technologies it is investing so deeply in across its mobile platforms and its work to .The new feature should also relate well with Apple\u2019s newly introduced city guides feature in Maps.

(Though perhaps less on the advertising, given Apple\u2019s focus on reducing the friction users suffer from that).The move to add user-submitted information to Maps will make Apple less reliant on third-party information services, but should also prompt business users to prioritise adding information concerning their business to Apple Maps \u2013 possibly supplemented by .Please follow me on"},
{"title": "Top web browsers 2020: Firefox, IE, Chrome all fall", "img_url": "https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/08/internet_web_browser_https_url_address_bar_by_ruslan_khismatov_gettyimages-1024793222_cw_2400x1600-100854835-large.jpg", "contents": "Mozilla's Firefox slumped, Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) crashed, and even Google's Chrome dropped last month in the global struggle for market share.August was as unkind to browsers as the year has been to their users.According to data published yesterday by California-based analytics company Net Applications, Firefox's share fell by two-tenths of a percentage point, ending August at 7.1%, a record low in its years-long decline. The last time the browser held such a small share was more than 15 years ago, in March 2005, as it was building to be a legitimate alternate to the then-monarch IE.By Net Applications' measurements, Firefox lost the equivalent of 2.2% of its share during August. Mozilla's own data \u2014 in the form of , or MAU \u2014 also showed a decline for Firefox, albeit a smaller 1.3% downturn.Firefox's troubles have so accumulated that the open-source browser resembles a beat up junker near the end of a demolition derby: It's a wonder it keeps going.Mozilla not only has to deal with the share decline of its premier product but also with financial troubles going as far back as 2018, and more recently, a  of a quarter of its workforce. Every month's share decline only reminds users \u2014 whether current or potential \u2014 of Firefox's fragility.Nor does 's forecast bring good news. The latest predicts that Firefox will fall below 7% in October (a month earlier than last month's prognostication), and pegs Firefox's share a year from now at 5.8%.How much longer can Firefox take this? That's a question  can't answer. There is no set number at which a browser becomes inconsequential. But there also has never been a browser that, after accounting for at least 25% of all share, has recovered from a decline that drove it into the single digits.Chrome's share in August slipped to 70.9%, a decline of one-tenth of a percentage point. The stumble was the first of 2020; Chrome had gained ground each of the preceding seven months. Even so, Chrome remained up 4.3 points for the year. (In fact, it was the only top five browser to post a plus for 2020.)The small decline did not change 's forecast for Chrome. Based on the browser's 12-month average change in share, the latest prediction reiterated that Chrome should make 72% by December and 73% by March 2021.Does Chrome have it in itself to keep gobbling up share? If so, how much? Those are tough questions.A year ago, it looked like Chrome had hit its limit; during 2019, the browser went up and it went down, but it ended the year down by six-tenths of a percentage point, at around 66.6%. That, it seemed, was that. But in the first eight months of 2020, Chrome has shown it had more gas in the tank, adding another four-plus points.It's easy to envision Chrome taking an additional two points from Firefox \u2014 leaving Mozilla's browser with just 5% or so \u2014 and grabbing another two points as IE nearly vanishes. Those gains would give it 75%. But further share redistribution would be harder. In fact, based on the numbers, Chrome's top job going forward would have to be keeping a lid on Edge by hampering any Microsoft effort to grow its newest browser.Microsoft's browsers lost a whopping 2.1 percentage points in August, ending last month at a combined 12.3%. called that a month ago, after Net Applications posted its July report, saying that the 1.9-point increase for IE and Edge was \"unbelievable\" and pointing out that in earlier instances, huge gains were quickly repudiated by follow-on months' data. \"It's unlikely that the enormous increase will stand, signaling that it's more an artifact of Net Applications' counting or how it weights some results over others,\" we said at the time.So it was.The 2.1-point loss in August took back all of the 1.9-point gain of the month before, then added another bit of decline for good measure. Compare August's number with June's, though, ignore July entirely, and Microsoft's slide over July and August comes out as about equal to the average monthly decline for the 12 months  July (in other words, July 2019 through June 2020). Put another way, the effect of July 2020 was nullified and IE+Edge instead fell as expected.In August, IE's share plunged by 2.2 points to 3.8%, a record low for that decades-old browser. Meanwhile, Edge rose slightly \u2014 less than one-tenth of a percentage point \u2014 to 8.5%. The latter remains on track to reach 11% within a year.IE's future is cloudier. A 12-month forecast puts IE at zero by this time next year. But while Microsoft recently began  for the browser, it's certain that enterprises, which are wildly underrepresented (if represented at all) in Net Applications' data, will certainly still be running IE (or the IE mode within Edge) in a year's time.Edge, of course, is Microsoft's shot at reclaiming some kind of browser influence. It's been tough going thus far: Since the Chromium-based Edge's January debut, Edge has increased its share by only 1.5 percentage points, or about two-tenths of a point per month. That's not going to put much of a dent in Chrome. Edge's next opportunity for some kind of share bump will be when Microsoft releases Windows 10 20H2, the year's fall feature upgrade, which will come with Chromium Edge.Elsewhere in Net Applications' numbers, Apple's Safari climbed to 3.5% on the back of a half a percentage point gain, reversing the loss it suffered in July. Opera software's Opera also grabbed more share, ending August at 1%, an increase of two-tenths of a point.Net Applications calculates share by detecting the agent strings of the browsers used to reach the websites of Net Applications' clients. The company counts visitor sessions to measure browser activity."},

In this regard, Hager shared his own company\u2019s experience recruiting and onboarding new staff:\u201cWe sent everybody home on March 12,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSince that time, we have fully remotely onboarded over 70 employees and we brought on over 30 summer interns. We fulfilled our internships to over 30 students this summer, and they never came in to work. They were actually very productive all summer long, did a terrific job for us.\u201dIn terms of IT deployment, at least, he thinks his company has it covered with solutions for zero touch deployment of Mac, iPhone or iPad.Hager noted some of the approaches his company is taking to maintain a connection with remote teams:\u201cWe try and help our employees stay comfortable in their homes as much as possible,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I would really say it's creating a \u2013 one of my least favorite terms is socially distance.

As usual, the second number is the more important of the two; August's was 1.4 points higher than July's.Windows 10's percentage of  (that's the 69.6%) was larger than the percentage of  (the 60.6%), because Windows does not power every system. In August, Windows was the OS of slightly fewer than 87% of the world's personal computers, down just half of one-tenth of a point from July. Of the remaining 13%, all but four-tenths of a percentage point ran macOS, Linux or Chrome OS.As Windows 10's share ticked up, Windows 7's tocked down.The aged OS, which Microsoft struck off the support list in January, lost a little bit more than a percentage point of share of all PCs, dropping to 22.3%. That translated into 25.7% of Windows PCs only, a decline of 1.1 points from July.In the seven full months since Windows 7's retirement from support, the operating system has lost 3.3 percentage points, representing a downturn of approximately 14%.While that may seem a notable decline, it was nowhere near the pace \u00a0projected (at the end of January) the OS would take through the remainder of 2020. Then, the trend of the previous 12 months pointed to a decline of around a point per month, putting Windows 7 under the 20%-of-all-Windows-PCs bar by September, then falling even further \u2013 to around 17% \u2013 by year's end.As it turned out, that forecast was much too optimistic \u2013 even though it was in line with how Windows XP had behaved in 2014 \u2013 because it didn't account for the of Windows 7-to-Windows 10 migrations after the former's support deadline came and went. Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 7, a pay-for-post-retirement-support program, may have had an impact here.Instead of sliding under 20% by September, Windows 7 now looks unlikely to hit that mark until April 2021. And 17%? Figure the second half of July or first half of August for that. (Remember, these numbers are for percentage of Windows, not all personal computer operating systems.)'s forecast for Windows 10 taps those same months, but matches them with different figures. By April, Windows 10 may be close to 75%. Come July 2021, Windows 10 should account for an astounding 80% of Windows editions. (Looking a  way ahead, Windows 10 may hit 90%...in May 2023.)Elsewhere in Net Applications' numbers, August saw the first significant retrenchment by Linux since an uncharacteristic growth spurt started in April. The category, which lumps together all distributions, lost nine-tenths of a percentage point, falling to 2.7%. macOS recouped six-tenths of a point last month, pushing to near 9.6% and almost reaching its April mark.Net Applications calculates operating system share by detecting the agent strings of the browsers used to reach the websites of Net Applications' clients.

It's a natural  and the  It's a place to  \u2014 and soon, if you're in the right enterprise environment, a place to , too (!).Chrome OS has truly become  \u2014 a  from its initial position as the \"nothing OS\" when it first showed up on our doorsteps many moons ago. But aside from appealing to people with all of those aforementioned qualities, the humble Chromebook is slowly but surely gaining a new purpose and unique advantage over its competitors.It's something that's been shaping up subtly for a while but that Google is now openly promoting and pushing forward, and it's an asset so obvious-seeming, it's almost shocking that it hasn't been tapped into 'til now. It's the Chromebook's role as the ultimate Google machine \u2014 a single device where Google's services and search prowess come together in a singularly streamlined way. And if you think it's no big deal, well, you're missing the bigger picture.It was more of a passing side note than any bold declaration, but Google actually laid out its vision for this new  superpower in a  this week. The post was about new features coming into the Chrome OS environment as part of September's hefty operating system update. A smarter cross-device Wi-Fi password syncing system, a simplified system settings interface, and a more accessible mic-level slider were the headlining items. But casually dropped in the middle of the post was a quietly important paragraph:And there you have it: the \"everything button\" \u2014 the logical next step for what's evolved into the \"everything OS.\"It's easy to brush that away as a modest expansion, but having that all-in-one, \"everything button\" function really can impact your day-to-day work and ability to get stuff done. To some degree, that Chrome OS Launcher button has acted as a bit of an \"everything button\" for a while now, but the \"everything\" part of it has had a handful of missing elements \u2014 and Google hasn't done an especially great job of  its multipurpose nature and making sure we mortal Chromebook owners appreciate its potential.But with its new powers coming into play, that button \u2014 represented by a magnifying glass icon on most Chromebooks and (somewhat confusingly, with random-seeming inconsistency) a circle on Google's own Pixelbook line of devices \u2014 could almost be described as a \"button.\" Tap it, and in the one box that comes up, you can:That last part is huge, especially for anyone who also uses  or on a . And Assistant on Chrome OS can do  \u2014 everything from creating new documents to controlling your calendar and interacting with your cross-device reminders.There's just one catch: On most current Chromebooks, the Assistant remains frustratingly detached from the main Launcher experience. It's  but also  from the rest of the Launcher setup: If you want to interact with Assistant, you have to either click or tap an Assistant icon within the initial Launcher search box or press the Launcher key and \"A\" key together to pull it up.On Google's own Pixelbook line of devices, though, Assistant is integrated into the Launcher seamlessly \u2014 and my goodness, what a difference that makes. You just start typing into the single Launcher search box, and whatever's most appropriate comes up automatically as the top suggestion \u2014 whether that's an app:...a website:...a system setting:...or an Assistant-handled action:It's a seemingly subtle distinction but a significant one when it comes to real-world impact. Having Assistant right there, integrated in with everything else, makes it feel like a natural extension of the operating system. And it makes the idea of this \"everything button\" \u2014 the \" button\" \u2014 feel powerful and complete. Quite honestly, it's something you resent not having when you work on Chrome OS and then go back to a more traditional operating system environment.(And here's a little secret: You can actually get that native Assistant Launcher integration on any current Chromebook, even if it doesn't have the Pixel branding. I'll share the specific steps in  on Friday.)Factor in Google's  to turn the Play Store into a unified, all-in-one Chromebook app market, and you can see how the long-scattered pieces of the Chrome OS ecosystem are finally starting to coalesce into something sensible.Chrome OS is on the brink of becoming the place where Google's best capabilities come together to form a whole new kind of connected experience. It's an exciting new start for intelligent desktop computing \u2014 and beyond that, it shows us the type of thoroughly connected Google experience Android could, should, and hopefully one day  also provide."},

For example, in the UK:I am interested to learn of similar deals in other territories, as these would suggest \u00a0some coordination to Apple\u2019s approach.These deals quite clearly spell out Apple\u2019s focus on making its services an integral part of its wider platform, as it aims to generate recurring income streams and reduce customer churn.They also make it crystal clear that the company sees 5G as an enabling technology that will let it leapfrog its service offerings , reducing the hold on high-speed broadband access currently enjoyed by fixe-line cable companies.That\u00a0 also lends itself to this.In this model, mobile telcos get to replace the cable companies. In the UK, that\u2019s likely to spell bad (and, in my opinion, deserved) news for expensive operators such as Virgin Media, but this impact will be felt internationally as 5G is rolled out to a wider congregation of users.My opinion is that the only fixed line-based providers likely to survive will be those serving security-conscious enterprise clients; providers such as  and  come to mind.The deployment of 5G will take time.  that by 2025 there may be around 2.8 billion subscribers.
